  "One of the common misconceptions is that climbing is a dangerous sport. Bouldering is a specific discipline of climbing where climbers usually climb no higher than 4.5m. There is no need for ropes since the falling area is a large foam mat that catches the climbers when they land.",
  "Unlike most sports, climbing is an individual sport. There is no requirement for teams, or even a playing partner. The challenge is you against the wall. This allows you to climb with others in a very fun, cooperative environment. You can boulder alone or with friends. The experience is fun either way!",
  "We see people form new friendships daily in the gym as they work on the climbs throughout the gym. The sport is truly a unique experience and it is no wonder why it is so rapidly growing in popularity."
